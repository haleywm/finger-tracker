# Finger Tracker

The purpose of this project is to track the location of a finger using webcam input and opencv-2.


## Setup

Please ensure that you have python 3 installed, with the opencv `cv2` library available. I reccommend installing a precompiled package using `pip install -U opencv-python` unless you already have it for other uses.

Other dependancies can be install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
